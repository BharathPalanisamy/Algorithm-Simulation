        <p><b>Algorithm</b>&nbsp;/ˈælɡəɹɪðəm/<br>In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (listen)) is a finite sequence of rigorous well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.[1]
            Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. By making use of artificial intelligence, algorithms can perform automated deductions (referred to as automated reasoning) and use mathematical and logical
            tests to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as automated decision-making). Using human characteristics as descriptors of machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by Alan Turing with terms such as "memory",
            "search" and "stimulus".&nbsp; (

        <p><b>Data structure</b><br> In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.[1][2][3] More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the
            relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data,[4] i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.&nbsp; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure">Wikipedia</a>) </p>
