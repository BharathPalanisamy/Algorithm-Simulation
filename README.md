# Algo-simulation
Purpose:
The purpose of Algo-simulation is to allow its users to get a better understanding of many different algorithms by having the freedom to customize different algorithms for their benefit. Algo-simulation was created to help people learn and understand different types of algorithms in a more creative and simpler fashion. 

# Functionality:
### Our application has the following functionalities:
Has a login/registration page with email and a reset password function <br/>
The selection of different types of algorithms <br/>
Inside the algorithm page, you have the option to enter multiple integers at once rather than inputting one at a time. <br/>
Users can decide if they want to see the pseudocode on the screen. <br/>
Users will  also be able to decide if they want to see a log box of the process being done on the screen. <br/>
User will also have an option of pausing and slowing down algorithm
